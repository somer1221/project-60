    <p> Swimming is a hobby that many share, including me. As for why I like it, it really depends on my early life. Some families act as though water is acid, not allowing their child to swim. But for me, I started going into the pool at a young age. That is why this habit has persisted, and for good reason too. Swimming is a form of exercise, meaning it also helps your heart, and reduces your risk of cardiac arrest, and chronic heart disease. Not to mention it being fun. These, and many more reasons are why I love swimming.</p>

        <p>This also means that swimming has many health benefits. Don't believe me? Look for yourself.</p>
